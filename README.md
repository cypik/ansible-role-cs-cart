We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. DevOps always promotes automation and standardisation. While setting up various environments like local, dev, testing, production, etc. it is critical to maintain the same environment across. This can easily be achieved using automating the environment setup & installation with the help of ansible-playbooks.

Smaller roles are created for each environment elements; which also include tasks & tests. These roles can then be grouped together in [ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html) to achieve the desired yet consistent results.
